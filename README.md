# BigTacToe
## It's TicTacToe, but bigger. (For a school project)

## Controls
Simply enough, you only need a number row to play and an enter key.
Type the row and column you wish to place your mark in, hit enter, repeat until victory.

This project only uses around 700~ KB of memory and runs WAY faster than Java could do here, while still being cross platform too!
