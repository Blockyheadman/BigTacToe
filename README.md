# BigTacToe
## It's TicTacToe, but bigger. (For a school project)

# NOTE
This program only compiles and runs when using DEBUG mode in Visual Studio 2022.
Due to compiler optimizations, it messes up the program somehow and makes it not work with those optimizations.

## Controls
Simply enough, you only need a number row to play and an enter key.
Type the row and column you wish to place your mark in, hit enter, repeat until victory.

This project only uses around 700~ KB of memory and runs WAY faster than Java could do here, while still being cross platform too!
